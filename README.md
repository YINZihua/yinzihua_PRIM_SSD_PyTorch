# yinzihua_PRIM_SSD_PyTorch

The reason I chose the SSD algorithm is because this algorithm can meet the real-time requirements for object detection. After training the SSD model on Colab and testing some video data sets, I will try to establish an online detection system to connect the webcam of other devices with the SSD detection model on colab to perform real-time operation on the video signal.
